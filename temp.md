### Description of the problem domain
Our chosen problem domain is communication and social media platforms. 
We're looking to create an application that is able to store key information about various users and allow them to communicate via text.

### High level description of our application
We aim to create a messaging platform and hopefully evolve it into a social networking platform. 
Our inspiration is to provide a new way for users to connect, communicate, and engage with others. To start with, we are working on our minimum viable product of a simple messaging platform that allows two users to chat with one another and maintains a record of previous conversations.
Our end goal is to have an application that lets users create profiles, chat with friends, share content, and discover new connections.
